An in-memory database is a type of database that stores data in the computer's main memory or RAM, giving it faster access speed compared to other types of databases. This makes it particularly useful for applications that require very high or real-time read/write speeds such as gaming, web applications and financial transactions. In contrast to traditional databases which store their data on disk, in-memory databases are generally limited in the amount of data they can store due to their reliance on the computer's available RAM.
