Kappa architecture is a big data processing pattern that has historically diverged from [[Lambda Architecture|Lambda]]. Its foundation is to treat all arriving data as a stream, therefore it contains no batch layer by design, relying solely on a [[Stream Data Processing|stream processing]] layer ("speed layer").

%%{init: { "flowchart": { "useMaxWidth": true } } }%%

graph LR

  

A((Message Broker))

  

subgraph Speed Layer

B("Stream processing job (n)")

C("Stream processing job (n+1)")

end

  

A --> B

A --> C

  

subgraph Serving Layer

D("Output table (n)")

E("Output table (n+1)")

end

  

B --> D

C --> E
```
## Kappa Architecture Advantages

- Only need to maintain, develop and debug a much smaller codebase compared to Lambda architecture.
- Advantageous for use cases that require high data velocity.
## Kappa Architecture Disadvantages

- General challenges related to implementing stream processing at scale.
- Higher data loss risks by design - requires specific data storage and recovery strategies.
