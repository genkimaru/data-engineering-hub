[Benthos](https://www.benthos.dev/) is a free and open source data streaming engine written entirely in Go and packaged as a static single-binary command line tool. It comes with a wide range of [connectors](https://www.benthos.dev/docs/about/#components) and is totally data agnostic.

Data transformations can be expressed using a high-level DSL called [Bloblang](https://www.benthos.dev/docs/guides/bloblang/about/), or blobl for short, which is a language designed for mapping data of a wide variety of forms.

It also exposes a [Go API](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/benthosdev/benthos/v4) which allows users to import Benthos as a library and extend it through custom plugins.

[Benthos Studio](https://studio.benthos.dev/) is an application that provides visual editing and testing capabilities for Benthos pipelines.
