[Metricflow](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/about-metricflow) translates a simple metric definition into reusable SQL, and executes it against the SQL engine of your choice. This makes it easy to get consistent metric output broken down by attributes (dimensions) of interest. Metricflow was [acquired by dbt labs in Feburary 2023](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/dbt-acquisition-transform) and now requires a dbt project in order to use it.
