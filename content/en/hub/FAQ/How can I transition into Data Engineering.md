It's fairly common for people to transition into Data Engineering from another data-related role. The [most common roles that people have successfully transitioned from](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/peoguf/data_engineers_that_transitioned_from_a_noncs/) are: Data Analyst, Business Intelligence Analyst or Developer, Backend Engineer, and Data Scientist. However, there are plenty of people who transitioned from other roles not listed above.

The general advice is to learn the [[What skills do I need to become a Data Engineer|core skills needed to become a data engineer]] and then either try to get some real-world experience at your current workplace or do a project to showcase your skills.
