Responsibilities are going to change depending on the company you work for and what seniority level you are at but generally speaking most data engineers do the following:

- **Gather data requirements** such as how long the data needs to be stored, how it will be used and what people and systems need access to the data.
- **Maintain metadata about the data** such as what technology manages the data, data documentation, how the data is secured, the source of the data and the ultimate owner of the data.
- **Ensure security and governance for the data** using centralized security controls like LDAP, encrypting the data, and auditing access to the data.
- **Store the data** using specialized technologies that are optimized for the particular use of the data, such as a [[Relational Database|relational database]], a [[Non-relational Database|NoSQL database]], or blob storage.
- **Process data for specific needs** using tools that access data from different sources, transform and enrich the data, summarize the data and store the data in the storage system.
