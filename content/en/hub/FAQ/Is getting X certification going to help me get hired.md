In the U.S., employers generally don't value certifications as proof of ability to do the job so the general advice from data engineers is not to expect it to add value to your resume or directly improve your chances of getting hired. Instead, use certifications to upskill and focus on the skills you've gained through projects if your goal is to find a job as a Data Engineer.

One caveat is if you are planning on working as a Data Engineer at a consulting firm then you will likely need to be certified in the tools that the firm uses. But again, most companies have no certification requirements and while it doesn't hurt your resume you don't want to waste time getting a certification just to get one.

If you have time and you still want to get a certification, the most valuable certifications to get are the ones from the top cloud providers.
