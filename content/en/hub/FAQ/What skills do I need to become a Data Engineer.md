There is no one set of tools that will get you a job as a Data Engineer. It will depend on the company, industry, and the need for data engineering where you live. Unlike other guides, this guide will list the minimum requirements needed (generally) to get a job as a Data Engineer. For each role, skills are listed in order of general importance and what level of mastery is needed for that role.

**Data Engineering Roles:**

# Junior Data Engineer

There are very few of these roles currently but similar roles with different titles may exist. For example, if you're a BI developer, SQL developer, or backend engineer then you probably have overlapping experience.
